                <p>Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call</p>
                <p>Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall</p>
                <p>You've seen it all, you've seen it all</p>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Watched the men who rode you, switch from sails to steam</p>
                <p>And in your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen</p>
                <p>Most of 'em dream, most of 'em dream</p>

                <p>Yes, I am a pirate, two hundred years too late</p>
                <p>The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder</p>
                <p>I'm an over-40 victim of fate</p>

                <p>I've done a bit of smugglin'</p>
                <p>And I've run my share of grass</p>
                <p>I made enough money to buy Miami but I pissed it away so fast</p>
                <p>Never meant to last, never meant to last</p>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>And I have been drunk now for over two weeks</p>
                <p>I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks</p>
                <p>But I got to stop wishin', got to go fishin'</p>
                <p>Down to rock bottom again</p>

                <p>I go for younger women, lived with several a while</p>

                <p>Still could manage to smile</p>
